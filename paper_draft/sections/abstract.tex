\section*{Abstract}
Prediction markets aggregate collective wisdom to forecast future events, producing probabilistic outputs that are often abstract and difficult for the general public to conceptualize.
We propose \ours, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework that transforms these raw probabilities into grounded, narrative news stories from the future.
By integrating a dedicated \analyst to interpret market resolution criteria and a \journalist to synthesize narratives, our system generates stories that are both highly consistent with market data (4.9/5 consistency score) and stylistically plausible (4.1/5 plausibility score).
We validate our approach on a dataset of real-world prediction markets from \manifold, demonstrating that grounding generation in specific market metadata significantly reduces hallucinations compared to zero-shot baselines.
Our work bridges the gap between quantitative forecasting and qualitative storytelling, offering a novel interface for exploring future scenarios.
