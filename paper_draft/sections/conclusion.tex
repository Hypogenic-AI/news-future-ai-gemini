\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented \ours, a Generative Journalism system that turns prediction markets into news.
By leveraging a multi-agent architecture to separate logical grounding from narrative synthesis, we achieved high consistency and plausibility in generated stories.
This work demonstrates that GenAI can effectively ``collapse'' the probabilistic superposition of future events into tangible, readable narratives, making the future more accessible to all.
We release our code and dataset to facilitate further research in grounded narrative generation.
